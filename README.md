# Atomic React Pattern Lib

A react pattern library with collocation of generic components and equipped with ideal react development ecosystem. 

## Why a Component Library?

> **_A component library helps you achieve consistent branding as it becomes the single source of truth for every component not only in the application but for all projects in the organization._**

> **_Instead of duplicating the component code across features in your project, implement the component from a central source, like a component library._**
